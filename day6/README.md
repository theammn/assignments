Let's explain what we aim to do now!

For this Python class project, I chose to analyze qPCR results obtained from my lab work on knockout (KO) lines. These lines are designed to target specific proteins that interact with TDP43, a protein closely linked to neurodegeneration and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing qPCR data. The script calculates Delta Ct, Real Change, and Fold Change values for different sample lines and generates a bar plot comparing these values.
After installing the requirements, you can run the functions.py and then check with test.py
