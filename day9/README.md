# DNA Sequence Analyzer

## Description

This script analyzes DNA sequences from a FASTA or GeneBank file. It can perform the following analyses:
1. **Find the longest repeating sub-sequence:** Identifies the longest sub-sequence within the DNA that appears more than once.
2. **Calculate the GC content:** Determines the percentage of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases in the DNA sequence.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command format:

```bash
python analysis.py tdp43.fasta [--duplicate] [--gc_content]
```

Here as an example, we have the fasta file of TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43), which is a protein involved in RNA processing and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and frontotemporal dementia.
